              If you are reading this, then you wanted take a second to
              understand me better in order to see if I could indeed help.
              Everyone is good at something. Some people are builders, some
              managers of people, some make beautiful art. As for me, I have
              always been an educator. If you were to watch my family’s home
              movies you would in no time find me explaining things in great
              detail to the camera.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
              Helping others to understand has always been a passion of mine and
              something that I find natural and fun. This is not to say that I
              am the best or that can explain anything to anyone. Rather it is
              to give you an idea of who I am and why I care. We each have
              something to offer and this is mine. I take something other people
              know and make it something you know. If someone else can do it, I
              am sure you and yours can too.

              No one works magic, not even magicians. Once its shown clearly how
              the trick is done, it stops being mystical and starts becoming
              mundane. The same applies to anything in the realm of learning,
              especially when it comes to forms of mathematics. Once explained,
              it is shown for what it truly is: small simple steps with majestic
              results. Now... let’s pull a rabbit out of your hat!

          <p class="lead card-header">Do you live with ADD/ADHD?</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>
              If you are reading this, than you are quite special. You or
              someone you love has one the greatest blessings/curses that we
              find our world today- being born with ADD. At some times,
              achieving more than anyone expected, while at others falling short
              of even acceptable. Your struggle is not unique, even though you
              are. The CDC now says that upwards of 20% of our population has
              some form of ADD. In my opinion this shows that it is a completely
              misnamed occurrence. To call anything that effects one fifth of
              our population a “disorder” is absurd. You are not broken, our
              system is. Sadly, while we are in the process of fixing that, true
              change will not be seen for years. In the meantime, figuring out
              how to dance to the music played by society, even if you are
              double-time to the music, is still something that should be
              practiced. As someone who has only known a world through the lens
              of ADD I offer my condolences and help.
            </p>

            <p>
              The world has so many things to thank the ADD community for,
              whether it be Michelangelo’s inventive work or Einsteins reality
              changing theorems you had better believe ADD was one of the
              driving forces. This didn’t stop with them and it wont stop with
              you. ADD people will be at the forefront of changes today and in
              the future. However, figuring out how to work with our special
              skill is of the utmost importance. George Washington Carver would
              have effected none of us if he hadn’t figured out how to take
              proper notes. Marie Currie wouldn’t have saved thousands of lives
              if she never figured out how to organize her thoughts and results.
              Working with the system is how anything gets done.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not to say that there is something wrong with the way you
              do things, rather this is to say world is made of many types and
              to get true work done it takes accounting for all of them. While
              we may have be built the world it doesn’t mean the world is built
              for us. Together however, we will change the world and for the
              better.
